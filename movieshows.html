    <h3><em>Friends: 1994-2004</em></h3>
    <img src="media//friends.jpg" alt="friends tv show intro where all of the cast are shown hugging and being friendly">
    <p>My favorite show of all time. Friends showcases the ups and downs of life with a lot of laughter in between. It shows banter and fun among friends. In 1994, the idea was created for "Friends": a show about six friends in New York as they navigate their way through life and learn to grow up as they approach the third decade of their life. Friends made me laugh a lot and really helps you step out of stress in your life and helps you understand that nothing is as bad as it seems.</p>

    <h3><em>Wrath of Man: 2021</em></h3>
    <img src="media//wom.jpg" alt="wrath of man movie cover and the cover shows jason statham">
    <p>One of my favorite movies is Wrath of Man because its attention to detail and how everything adds up at the end makes it satisfying. It's a movie about a gangster's son who runs LA being murdered by a gang of thieves robbing an armored truck carrying millions of dollars. Although the dad was shot many times, he lived and he comes up with an elaborate plan to get revenge on his son, and find out who killed him. This movie showcases the blood bond between a father and son, and also how far that bond takes the dad to revenge upon his son. Wrath of Man premiered in 2021, with Jason Statham playing the main character!</p>
